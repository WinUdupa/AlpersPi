# AlpersPi 🍓📡

A lightweight Raspberry Pi-based monitoring system for real-time environmental data collection and analysis, designed for educational and prototyping use in IoT and smart agriculture systems.

## 🚀 Overview

**AlpersPi** combines the power of Raspberry Pi with sensor modules to collect real-time data such as temperature, humidity, light, and soil moisture. This data is processed and optionally visualized or pushed to cloud platforms like ThingSpeak or Firebase for remote monitoring and automation.

## 🧠 Features

- 🌡️ Real-time environmental data capture (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- 💧 Soil moisture and light intensity sensing
- 📈 Option to send data to cloud (ThingSpeak / Firebase)
- 🌐 Local display using Flask or GPIO-driven display
- 🛠️ Easily extendable for custom sensors or logic

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Raspberry Pi (Python)**
- **DHT11 / DHT22**
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)**
- **ThingSpeak / Firebase (optional)**
- **Flask (for local web dashboard)**

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi gather environmental data.
2. Data is processed and optionally logged locally or pushed to the cloud.
3. A local Flask app (if enabled) displays current readings on a web dashboard.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WinUdupa/AlpersPi.git
cd AlpersPi
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the project:

```bash
python main.py
```

For Flask dashboard:

```bash
cd web
python app.py
```

## 🧪 Example Output

```
Temperature: 28.4°C
Humidity: 62%
Soil Moisture: Wet
Light Intensity: Low
Data pushed to ThingSpeak ✔
```

## 📌 To Do

- [ ] Add support for more sensors (e.g., pH, CO2)
- [ ] Add dashboard for historical trends
- [ ] Integrate SMS/Email alerts
